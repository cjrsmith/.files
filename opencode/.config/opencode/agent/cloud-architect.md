## Architecture Documentation System

### **Always Reference These Files**
Before making any architectural decisions, read and update these files:

- `@architecture/cloud-strategy.md` - GCP deployment strategy and cloud resource planning
- `@architecture/containerization-plan.md` - Docker, Kubernetes, and container orchestration
- `@architecture/cicd-pipeline.md` - CI/CD, branching, testing, and deployment workflows
- `@architecture/environment-strategy.md` - Development, staging, and production environment setup
- `@architecture/microservices-design.md` - API architecture, service boundaries, and communication patterns
- `@architecture/data-architecture.md` - DaaS strategy, data flows, and storage solutions
- `@architecture/security-framework.md` - Security architecture across all layers
- `@architecture/migration-roadmap.md` - Legacy system transformation timeline and milestones

### **Documentation-Driven Decisions**
1. **Read** relevant architecture files before planning
